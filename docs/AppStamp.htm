  <h2><a name="A1">Description</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A1">AppStamp is a free, open source system that enables a
  program to update itself from a web site. It includes a pair of
  utilities: Stamp.exe for a developer to record the time stamp of a
  program before uploading it to a web site, and Elevate.exe for a user
  to check whether a newer version of the program is available, and if
  so, download and install it. AppStamp works on any version of
  Windows.</a></p>

  <h2><a name="A2">Installation</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A2">The installer for AppStamp is called
  AppStamp_setup.exe. The default location for the program is<br>
  C:\AppStamp</a></p>

  <p>Although a different location may be chosen, this one tendds to be
  more practical for developers using the command line than, say,<br>
  C:\Program Files (x86)\AppStamp</p>

  <p>Only a developer needs to install the full AppStamp package. A
  user may have a component installed, Elevate.exe, as part of a
  program distribution.</p>

  <p>The AppStamp installer also creates a desktop shortcut and a
  program group within the Windows Start Menu, with options to launch
  each utility, read documentation, or uninstall.</p>

  <h2><a name="A3">The Stamp Utility</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A3">Stamp.exe records the time stamp of a program in the
  file AppStamp.ini, located by default at<br>
  C:\AppStamp\AppStamp.ini</a></p>

  <p>This ini file has a section called Versions, containing an entry
  for each program being tracked. For example, here is an entry for the
  PDF2TXT program:</p>

  <p>[Versions]<br>
  PDF2TXT=3.4|2012-02-09 11:54</p>

  <p>This means that the latest version of PDF2TXT is numbered 3.4 with
  a time stamp of February 2, 2009 at 11:54. Note that the version
  number and time stamp are seperated by a vertical bar character (|),
  and that a 24-hour clock is used (18:30 is 6:30 PM). The time format
  allows time stamps to be compared as strings.</p>

  <p>Stamp.exe needs four parameters to create the AppStamp.ini entry:
  (1) the name of the program, (2) the path of one of its files on
  disk, (3) the path of AppStamp.ini, and (4) the version of the
  program. These parameters Are passed on the command line, or the
  utility prompts for them if none are passed. A parameter containing a
  space, e.g., as part of a folder path, should be enclosed in quotes.
  Alternatively, the parameters may be included in an ini file that is
  passed as a single parameter to Stamp.exe. For example, such an ini
  file might look as follows:</p>

  <p>[Stamp]<br>
  AppName=PDF2TXT<br>
  AppPath=C:\PDF2TXT\PDF2TXT.exe<br>
  AppStampIniPath=c:\AppStamp\AppStamp.ini<br>
  AppVersion=3.4</p>

  <p>The stamp utility examines the file in the AppPath parameter,
  using its date and time in the entry it puts in AppStamp.ini. The
  AppPath parameter may refer to any file distributed with a program.
  It does not have to be an executable file, but should be a file that
  is updated whenever a new version of the program is prepared for
  distribution, e.g., a documentation file that is saved with revised
  information.</p>

  <p>When a developer uploads a new version of the program to a web
  site, the new AppStamp.ini file should also be uploaded there. The
  Elevate utility on the client computer will compare its own time
  stamp to the one in the AppStamp.ini file on the web site. It will
  thus deduce whether a newer, current, or older version of the program
  is available from the web site.</p>

  <h2><a name="A4">The Elevate Utility</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A4">Elevate.exe is distributed with the program
  downloaded from the web site. It needs five parameters: (1) the name
  of the program, (2) the path of one of its files on disk, (3) the URL
  of AppStamp.ini on the web site, (4) the URL of the program&#39;s
  setup file on the web site, and (5) the name of the setup file. These
  parameters may be passed either on the command line or in an ini file
  passed as a single parameter to Elevate.exe. For example, such an ini
  file might look like the following:</a></p>

  <p>[Elevate]<br>
  AppName=PDF2TXT<br>
  AppPath=C:\PDF2TXT\PDF2TXT.exe<br>
  AppStampIniURL=http://EmpowermentZone.com/AppStamp.ini<br>
  AppStamp_setup.exeURL=http://EmpowermentZone.com/p2tsetup.exe<br>
  AppStamp_setup.exe=p2tsetup.exe</p>

  <p>Although the URL of the setup program typically ends in its file
  name, that does not have to be the case -- thus, a seperate parameter
  for the file name.</p>

  <p>A program can either run Elevate.exe automatically, e.g., at
  startup, or in response to a request by the user. Such a request
  could be a menu item in the program, a hotkey, or a shortcut in a
  program group within the Windows Start Menu. The Elevate utility
  compares a local time stamp to one on the server, and prompts whether
  to download and install the server version of the program by means of
  its executable file there. If the server version is found to be
  newer, the default choice is Yes. Otherwise, it is No.</p>

  <p>If the user chooses Yes, the setup file is downloaded to the
  Windows special folder for temporary files. A message box then asks
  the user to close the program so that files may be replaced during
  the installation process. After the user closes the program and
  presses the OK button in the message box, the setup file is executed,
  thereby installing a new version of the program.</p>

  <p>A side effect of this process is that the setup file is left in
  the Temp folder. The next time the Elevate process occurs, that file
  will be replaced by a newer version. If the developer would prefer
  not to leave such a file, the program can delete it from the Temp
  folder if found upon startup.</p>

  <p>You can try an Elevate example by choosing the Elevate AppStamp
  shortcut, located within the AppStamp program group of the Windows
  Start Menu.</p>

  <h2><a name="A5">Development Notes</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A5">For the technically interested, I developed AppStamp
  with the PowerBASIC compiler from<br></a><a href=
  "http://PowerBASIC.com">http://PowerBASIC.com</a></p>

  <p>This compiler creates small executables, which do not add
  significant size to a distribution package of a program. By default,
  source code is in the folder<br>
  C:\AppStamp\source</p>

  <p>The installer for AppStamp is developed with Inno Setup from<br>
  <a href="http://InnoSetup.org">http://InnoSetup.org</a></p>

  <p>The latest version of the installer is available at<br>
  <a href=
  "http://EmpowermentZone.com/AppStamp_setup.exe">http://EmpowermentZone.com/AppStamp_setup.exe</a></p>

  <p>I welcome feedback, which helps AppStamp improve over time. When
  reporting a problem, the more specifics the better, including steps
  to reproduce the problem, if possible.</p>
