AppStamp is a free, open source system that enables a program to update itself from a web site.  It includes a pair of utilities: Stamp.exe for a developer to record the time stamp of a program before uploading it to a web site, and Elevate.exe for a user to check whether a newer version of the program is available, and if so, download and install it.  AppStamp works on any version of Windows.

Full documentation is in the file AppStamp.htm within the docs subdirectory.  Source code and other development files are in the source subdirectory.
